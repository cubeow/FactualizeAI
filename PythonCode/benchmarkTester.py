These changes not only threaten the biodiversity and viability of this ecosystem but also the economic value it provides, notably a $7 billion annual commercial fishery. Given the Great Lakes\' significance as a source of more than 20% of the world’s and over 80% of North America’s freshwater, the claim that it is our responsibility to protect this vital ecosystem against climate change damage is well-founded. The evidence underscores the urgency of conservation efforts, including emission reductions, sustainable policy implementation, species protection, and community engagement, to mitigate these adverse effects. However, the claim is rated \'Mostly True\' instead of \'True\' because while the evidence extensively validates the impact of climate change on the Great Lakes and the need for action, attributing the full scope of \'damage\' and \'obligation\' to human actions is slightly more nuanced. Factors such as natural climate variability play a role, alongside human-induced climate change, in ecosystem alterations. Nonetheless, the claim is substantially supported by the evidence, emphasizing the critical need for human intervention and conservation efforts."\n}': True, '{\n  "rating": "Mostly False",\n  "explanation": "The claim that Wisconsin has lost 6,000 manufacturing jobs and 455 dairy farms in the last year under President Biden is mostly false. According to the data referenced, the actual loss in manufacturing jobs was reported as 2,300 according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve, with the Republican Party of Wisconsin admitting to having the wrong timeline and stating the loss was more significant from September 2022 to September 2023, but less than initially claimed, correcting it to a loss of 7,300. However, jobs rebounded slightly from this loss, indicating that the initial claim exaggerated the figures. Additionally, the claim of losing 455 dairy farms within the same timeframe was confirmed, making this part of the claim true. However, attributing these losses solely to the current administration and labeling it as an \'abysmal record\' under \'Bidenomics\' ignores the long-term trends affecting both the manufacturing and dairy farm sectors that are influenced by numerous factors beyond the direct control of a single presidency. Therefore, the claim\'s simplistic attribution to the Biden administration and its policies does not accurately reflect the complexity of the issues at hand."\n}': 'Mostly False', '{\n  "Rating": "Mostly False",\n  "Explanation": "The evidence compiled from various sources suggests that immigrants contribute positively to the financial health of Social Security and Medicare systems through payroll taxes. The assertion that immigrants will destroy Social Security due to unsustainability is largely contradicted by findings indicating that immigrants can help address workforce challenges, thereby potentially reducing the projected shortfall in Social Security funding. Strategic reforms aimed at increasing the number of working-age taxpayers through adjustments in immigration policy could facilitate more substantial contributions to these systems. Furthermore, the studies highlight that while immigrants may initially have lower expected resources from Social Security than natives, this gap decreases with additional years of US residency, indicating a net positive impact over time. Thus, the claim that Social Security will be \'destroyed\' by incoming immigrants is mostly false, as evidence points towards a beneficial rather than detrimental impact of immigration on the sustainability of Social Security."\n}': False, '{\n  "Rating": "Mostly False",\n  "Explanation": "The evidence indicates that there have been fluctuations in the funding and staffing levels of the Milwaukee Police Department. The proposed 2024 budget by Mayor Cavalier Johnson suggests a focus on maintaining and possibly increasing police and fire department staffing with no service cuts, enabled by a sales tax increase. However, contrasting this, the 2023 proposed budget notes a 1% reduction in sworn police officers and a decrease in average sworn strength from 1,657 to 1,640 officers. Additionally, a document discussing a 25% budget cut scenario outlines significant consequences such as the loss of 602 police positions and the elimination of specific units. These changes do not align with the statement that Milwaukee has \'never defunded the police\'. The evidence of budget cuts, even with subsequent restoration or stability efforts, suggests that reductions in police funding and resources have occurred, contradicting the claim of never defunding the police."\n}': 'mostly true', '{\n  "rating": "False",\n  "explanation": "ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, is not directly owned by the Chinese government. The evidence clearly illustrates that ByteDance is a privately held company with significant portions of its ownership attributed to global investors, its Chinese co-founders, and its employees, including those based in the United States. Specifically, 60% of ByteDance is owned by global investors, 20% by its co-founders, and 20% by its employees. Only a minor stake (1%) in one of ByteDance\'s China-based subsidiaries has been linked to the Chinese government, which does not equate to direct ownership or control of ByteDance itself by the Chinese government. Although there are claims of government influence and operational realities in China that suggest a complicated relationship between the state and private enterprises, where government interests may indirectly influence company actions, there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that the Chinese government \'owns\' ByteDance. Therefore, despite the nuanced relationship and potential for government influence within the broader regulatory and political framework in China, the claim that the Chinese government owns ByteDance is rated as false."\n}': False, '{\n  "rating": "Mostly False",\n  "explanation": "The evidence shows that President Biden\'s administration has indeed made substantial changes to the United States\' immigration and deportation policies. The administration has emphasized prioritizing public safety, national security, and border security in its enforcement efforts, especially focusing on individuals suspected of terrorism, espionage, or those not physically present before November 1, 2020. It has also revoked some Trump-era policies, attempted to institute a moratorium on deportations (which was blocked by a judge), and has enacted policies that could allow some individuals to stay in the U.S. under certain circumstances, such as prosecutorial discretion and expanded parole programs for nationals of specific countries. However, these actions do not amount to a \'formal policy that illegal aliens who intrude into the United States are granted immunity from deportation.\' The policies do not grant blanket immunity; rather they refocus enforcement efforts and provide pathways for staying in the U.S. under specific conditions, which is a far stretch from immunity. Thus, the claim is \'Mostly False.\'"\n}': False, '{\n  "rating": "False",\n  "explanation": "The claim that only immigrants in the country illegally are eligible for an interest-free California housing loan program is false. The evidence shows that the California legislature has proposed expanding an existing state loan program, known as the California Dream for All Shared Appreciation Loans program, to include undocumented immigrants. However, the program was not solely established for them but initially targeted first-time homebuyers, including requirements for applicants to be first-generation home buyers and meet certain income thresholds. The aim is to expand eligibility among qualified first-time buyers, which encompasses a broader range of individuals beyond undocumented immigrants. Therefore, the program is not exclusive to illegal immigrants but is available to a wider audience that meets the program’s criteria."\n}': False, '{\n  "rating": "False",\n  "explanation": "The claim that trans activists replaced Easter with the Transgender Day of Visibility is false. Evidence clearly indicates that Transgender Day of Visibility has been celebrated on March 31 since its inception in 2009. The date was chosen to complement other significant dates in the trans community\'s calendar, specifically to avoid overlapping with Transgender Day of Remembrance in November and Pride Month in June. Easter, on the other hand, is a movable feast based on the lunar calendar, and its date changes every year. In 2024, the coincidence of Easter Sunday falling on the same day as Transgender Day of Visibility is purely incidental, not a case of one event replacing the other. President Joe Biden, who has issued proclamations recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility annually since taking office, did so while also celebrating Easter separately. Claims suggesting an intentional combination or replacement of the two observances are debunked by the established facts regarding the separate origins and dates of Easter and Transgender Day of Visibility. Therefore, the notion that Easter was \'replaced\' by the Transgender Day of Visibility is entirely unfounded."\n}': False, '{\n  "ClaimRating": "Mostly False",\n  "Explanation": "The claim that Citizens Property Insurance \'is not solvent\' is rated Mostly False based on the evidence provided. While Governor Ron DeSantis expressed concerns regarding the solvency of Citizens Property Insurance, suggesting potential issues in the event of a major storm, the CEO of Citizens, Tim Cerio, and Mark Friedlander from the non-partisan and nonprofit Insurance Information Institute, have both clarified the situation that contradicts this claim. According to the evidence, Citizens has a significant surplus, with reports of $5 billion and expectations to exceed $6 billion by the end of 2024. Additionally, it has $4.5 billion in cash on hand and has mechanisms in place, as a non-private insurer backed by Florida regulations, to ensure it remains solvent and able to cover all its claims. The capability to levy surcharges and draw funds to cover claims further strengthens the company\'s financial stability. While concerns by a high-profile figure like Governor DeSantis might lead to some questions about the company\'s financial health, the detailed financial data and regulatory support structure presented in the evidence strongly support the assessment that the claim of insolvency is mostly false."\n}': 'mostly false', '{\n  "Rating": "Mostly False",\n  "Explanation": "The claim that TikTok has been \'really just banned\' as of March 13, with users having \'6 months left to use it\' is mostly false. As of March 13, 2023, the House of Representatives passed a bill requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a potential ban in the U.S. This bill is now pending in the Senate, where its future is uncertain. Although the bill does set a timeline of approximately six months (165 days) for ByteDance to divest from TikTok to avoid a ban, it has not yet been enacted into law, and TikTok has not been officially banned as of the provided date. There are significant restrictions in place on federal and state employees in 34 states from using TikTok on government devices, but a complete nationwide ban, contingent upon the failure of ByteDance to divest, is not immediate or certain. The claim overlooks the current status that the outcome of this legislative effort is pending in the Senate and is not a finalized action as implied."\n}': False, '{\n  "rating": "False",\n  "explanation": "The claim that the 2020 election was the only time in American history that an election took more than 24 hours to count is false. Historically, counting votes in US elections, especially when considering absentee or mail-in ballots, has taken several days or even weeks. This is not unique to the 2020 election. For example, the election of 1800 between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr went to the House of Representatives due to a tie, and the final decision was made well after Election Day. In more recent history, the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore famously took over a month to decide, with the Supreme Court\'s decision in Bush v. Gore coming down on December 12, 2000. Thus, the process of counting votes and finalizing election results extending beyond 24 hours is not unprecedented in the United States."\n}': False, '{\n  "rating": "Mostly True",\n  "explanation": "The evidence provided indicates a significant increase in the U.S. national debt under President Biden\'s administration since the end of the 2020 fiscal year. The debt increase amounts reported vary slightly across the documents, with one stating an increase of over $5.56 trillion since President Biden took office and another projecting a total increase under Biden\'s initial term to be $7.902 trillion. These figures reflect a substantial increase in the national debt, comparing notably with past rates of debt accumulation, including the claim regarding the comparison to the debt accumulated in the first 228 years of U.S. history. However, the evidence does not specifically address Senator Baldwin\'s role in the debt increase, making it difficult to assess her contribution directly. Therefore, the claim about the debt increase under President Biden and Senator Baldwin adding over $7.3 trillion to the debt, compared to the first 228 years of U.S. history, is rated as \'Mostly True\' based on the available data about the debt increase under Biden\'s administration. The slight disparity in the amount and the lack of information directly attributing part of this increase to Senator Baldwin prevents a full \'True\' rating."\n}': 'half true', '{\n  "rating": "False",\n  "explanation": "The evidence provided clearly states that Donald Trump did not secure his bond from a Russian company in the E. Jean Carroll case. Instead, the bond, amounting to $91.6 million for the appeal in Carroll\'s civil defamation case against Trump, was secured through the Federal Insurance Company, which is a subsidiary of Chubb. Federal Insurance Company is based in Indiana, while Chubb, its parent company, is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland. Furthermore, it is mentioned that Chubb has offices in various countries including the U.S., United Kingdom, France, and Singapore, but not in Russia. This information directly contradicts the claim that a Russian company secured Trump’s bond in the E. Jean Carroll case."\n}': False, '{\n  "rating": "False",\n  "explanation": "The claim incorrectly attributes the phrase “do whatever the hell they want” to President Joe Biden, suggesting he said this, paused, and then remarked, “I guess I should clear my mind here a little bit.” In the evidence provided, it is clear that Biden was quoting or paraphrasing statements attributed to the previous president, presumably Donald Trump, concerning NATO allies and their financial contributions, as well as a permissive stance towards Russian aggression if those contributions were not met. Biden expressed disbelief and outrage at such a stance but did not claim these words as his own. Instead, he was criticizing the dangerous implications of such statements. The direct quote “do whatever the hell they want” is presented in the context as being part of Trump\'s rhetoric, not Biden\'s. Therefore, the claim misrepresents the context and content of Biden\'s statements."\n}': 'Mostly False', '{\n  "rating": "False",\n  "explanation": "Based on the evidence provided from multiple sources, the claim that Nancy Pelosi is responsible for the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol is rated as false. The evidence indicates that during the riot, Pelosi was not in a position to control the situation outside of her capacity as a target of the attackers. She was documented as being in a secure location, expressing disbelief and concern over the riot, and actively sought help to secure the Capitol. Furthermore, she was involved in efforts to call in support from the National Guard and coordinate with government officials to manage the crisis. Accusations suggesting Pelosi had a substantial role in the security posture prior to the attack are unsupported by direct evidence, and the structure of Capitol security oversight does not grant the Speaker of the House direct authority over Capitol Police or security operations. A bipartisan Senate investigation into the events also made no mention of Pelosi having a direct involvement in the security failures of that day. Therefore, attributing the responsibility for the attack to Pelosi contradicts the documented facts and lacks substantiation."\n}': False, '{\n  "rating": "Mostly True",\n  "explanation": "Based on the compiled evidence, we observe that among cities cited for having high rates of child poverty in the U.S., several are located in New York state: Rochester, NY is ranked #1 with the highest child poverty rate, Buffalo, NY is ranked #4, and other cities like Syracuse are mentioned with specific child poverty rates (45.8% for Syracuse, ranking it second). While the claim states \'Half of the cities with the highest rates of child poverty are in New York state,\' the provided evidence does not give a comprehensive list of all cities in the U.S. to verify if exactly half of the top-ranking cities for child poverty are indeed in New York state. However, the evidence clearly supports a significant presence of New York cities at the top of child poverty rate rankings in the U.S. Without the exact count of how many cities nationwide were evaluated or their child poverty rankings, it\'s challenging to conclusively determine if \'half\' of the highest-ranked cities are in New York. Nonetheless, the prominence of New York cities like Rochester, Buffalo, and Syracuse in these unfortunate standings supports the notion that New York state is disproportionately represented among cities with high child poverty rates. Thus, the statement is rated as \'Mostly True.\'"\n}': False, '{\n  "rating": "False",\n  "explanation": "The evidence provided indicates that Cindy McCain endorsed Joe Biden for the 2020 presidential election, not for an election in 2024. The statements focus on her endorsement coming as a result of Trump\'s behavior, specifically his comments about fallen soldiers and his treatment of her late husband, John McCain. There is no mention of an endorsement for Biden in 2024 in the evidence provided. Therefore, the claim that Cindy McCain endorsed Joe Biden in 2024 is rated as False based on the available information."\n}': False, '{\n  "rating": "Mostly False",\n  "explanation": "Based on the evidence provided, which indicates a job loss figure of 494,000 for native-born Americans in February, the claim that nearly 1 million jobs held by native-born Americans disappeared in February is exaggerated. The actual number is significantly less than 1 million, roughly half of the claimed amount. While there is a considerable number of job losses, the claim overstates the situation. The provided data does show a substantial job loss but does not support the magnitude of nearly 1 million as claimed."\n}': False, '{\n  "rating": "False",\n  "explanation": "After thoroughly reviewing the compiled evidence from various sources, it\'s clear that Canada is not passing a bill to \'essentially ban the idea of Christianity.\' Legislation in Canada, like in many democratic countries, often involves debates concerning freedom of expression, hate speech, and the protection of minority rights. However, characterizing any current legislative efforts as aiming to ban Christianity misrepresents the nature and intent of Canadian lawmaking processes. Canadian laws must adhere to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which includes the freedom of religion. Banning an entire religion or its ideological foundations would be unconstitutional under Canadian law. It\'s important to scrutinize the context and specific provisions of any bill in question. Misinterpretation or misinformation can lead to such exaggerated claims, which do not hold up against legal standards and principles in Canada."\n}': False, '{\n  "rating": "True",\n  "explanation": "Based on the provided evidence, the statement \'We\'re having the largest classes of correctional officers we\'ve ever had before\' can be rated as True. The evidence indicates that the state Department of Corrections graduated its largest training class ever in February with 214 graduates, with a graduation date specified as February 21, 2024. This directly supports the claim that current classes of correctional officers are the largest ever.

The data specifically reports approximately an 846% increase in encounters and apprehensions between October 1, 2022, and January 31, 2023, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Despite the significant percentage increase, it\'s important to note that while these figures are substantial for the Swanton sector, the actual numbers are relatively small, especially when compared to the figures at the southern U.S. border.

Schedule I drugs are described as having \'no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\' Both Fentanyl and Cocaine are classified as Schedule II drugs, which are considered to have a \'high potential for abuse, with use potentially leading to severe psychological or physical dependence\' but are acknowledged to have some accepted medical use, albeit with restrictions owing to their dangerous nature. Therefore, the claim that \'Marijuana is currently classified in the same category of drugs as heroin and a more dangerous category than fentanyl or cocaine\' aligns with the provided data, making the claim \'True.\'"\n}': True, '{\n  "rating": "Mostly True",\n  "explanation": "The evidence provided shows that expanding Medicaid in Wisconsin is indeed associated with significant financial savings, with figures outlining a savings of $530 million for the budget cycle of 2021-23 according to one source, and $1.6 billion in savings due to enhanced federal funds according to two other sources. The discrepancy in savings amount can be attributed to different aspects or calculations concerning Medicaid expansion, but the lower figure closely matches the claim\'s figure. Regarding the impact on funding for K-12 teachers, the first source directly supports the claim, suggesting that the savings could potentially hire 3,287 K-12 teachers or approximately 7.8 educators per district, based on statewide median salary and benefits calculations. This information is supported by data from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau and the Department of Public Instruction. However, the critical consideration is the potential rather than guaranteed use of savings for this purpose. The evidence indicates that while financial savings from Medicaid expansion could indirectly free up funds that might be directed towards education, the allocation of such savings to hire more K-12 teachers is subject to the discretion of local school districts and boards. This level of local control and the hypothetical nature of fund allocation for hiring teachers qualify the claim as \'Mostly True,\' acknowledging the solid basis in estimated financial savings and the calculated impact on teacher hiring, while recognizing the conditional aspects of fund allocation."\n}': True, '{\n  "rating": "Mostly True",\n  "explanation": "The evidence provided indicates a significant increase in Black and Hispanic business ownership during Joe Biden\'s presidency, with claims of Black business ownership doubling since 2019 and Hispanic business ownership up by 40%. This suggests a substantial rise in entrepreneurship among these groups. However, to confidently rate the claim as \'True,\' it would be essential to verify these figures against official data sources or reports that track business ownership by race and ethnicity over time, including the specific timeframe of Joe Biden\'s presidency. The data points toward a marked increase, supporting the claim of \'record numbers of new Black entrepreneurs.\' Nonetheless, without specific comparisons to historical data to confirm if these levels are truly unprecedented or the highest on record, a slight reservation is required, hence the \'Mostly True\' rating.

This expansion is attributed to two key pieces of legislation: the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. The American Rescue Plan Act, passed in 2021, allowed states to temporarily extend Medicaid postpartum coverage to 12 months. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 provided a pathway for states to make this extension permanent. This legislative framework, along with federal funding and guidance provided by the Biden administration, facilitated a significant increase in the number of states offering extended postpartum Medicaid coverage. The fact that 45 states (including the District of Columbia) now offer a full year of Medicaid and CHIP coverage after pregnancy demonstrates the substantial impact of the Biden administration\'s policies on postpartum Medicaid coverage expansion."\n}': True, '{\n  "rating": "False",\n  "explanation": "According to the provided evidence, Wisconsin had 1,358 opioid overdose deaths in 2022.

Two pieces of evidence directly highlight that 57% of students consider the cost of college as their top concern in relation to the economy. This shows a clear connection between college students\' primary concerns and economic factors, particularly those affecting their personal financial situations. Although the claim does not detail the specific aspect of the economy that concerns students, the evidence supports the broader assertion that the economy, through the lens of college affordability, is the top issue for a majority of them."\n}': True, '{\n  "rating": "True",\n  "explanation": "The provided evidence consistently supports and verifies the claim that in April of the previous year, Wisconsin\'s state unemployment rate reached a record low of 2.4%.

The claim is corroborated by multiple sources, all of which agree on the unemployment rate of 2.4% and highlight the historical significance of this figure both in terms of the rate itself and the total number of unemployed individuals. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data is cited as the data source, adding credibility to the figures presented. The information also includes a comparison of these rates to previous periods, including before the pandemic, further emphasizing the record-setting nature of the 2.4% unemployment rate and the corresponding number of unemployed people in Wisconsin."\n}': True, '{\n  "rating": "Mostly True",\n  "explanation": "Based on the evidence provided, it\'s indicated that 40% of women of reproductive age live in US states with abortion bans. This figure translates to 2 out of every 5 women fitting this demographic, which is slightly higher than the 1 in 3 statistic stated in the claim. While the claim underestimates the percentage slightly, it closely aligns with the provided 40% figure, indicating that a significant proportion of women of reproductive age indeed live in states with restrictive abortion access.

In contrast, during Donald Trump\'s administration (from 2017 to 2020), about 2 million people were deported. These figures include removals, returns, and Title 42 expulsions, accounting for the various metrics used to measure deportations. Notably, the data for fiscal year 2017 incorporates about four months of the Obama administration, and fiscal year 2009 includes a similar period from the George W. Bush administration. Despite this, Obama\'s deportation numbers in each of his terms still exceeded those during Trump\'s term.

This evidence robustly supports the claim that Barack Obama\'s administration deported more individuals than Donald Trump\'s administration."\n}': True, '{\n  "rating": "True",\n  "explanation": "Based on the compiled evidence, specifically highlighting that \'In 2023, fatal overdoses in the U.S. reached over 112,000\' due to fentanyl, supports the claim that more Americans have died from fentanyl overdoses than the combined fatalities in the Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars. Historical data on combat fatalities from these wars (with Vietnam War deaths estimated around 58,220, Iraq War deaths at approximately 4,497, and Afghanistan War deaths around 2,216, totaling roughly 64,933) when compared to the reported fentanyl fatalities, confirms that fentanyl-related deaths surpass the total number of military personnel killed during these wars combined. Additionally, the statement that \'Fentanyl is now the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 49\' and data from the Washington Post analysis of 2021 death data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention further support the gravity of the fentanyl crisis, validating the claim as \'True\'."\n}': True, '{\n  "rating": "False",\n  "explanation": "The claim states that the recommended ratio of school-based professional social workers to students is 400-to-1, and that in Wisconsin, the ratio is almost triple that. However, the evidence indicates that the recommended ratio is actually 250:1, not 400-to-1 as claimed. Furthermore, it suggests that the actual ratio in Wisconsin is 7 times the recommended standard, which is far beyond \'almost triple\' the recommended ratio. For specific examples, at East High the ratio is 616:1 and at Memorial it is 931:1, both of which significantly exceed both the claimed recommended ratio and the actual recommended ratio. Based on this evidence, the claim is rated as False."\n}': True, '{\n  "rating": "Mostly True",\n  "explanation": "The evidence provided shows two specific percentages, 54% and 57%, of world autocrats\' countries receiving arms from the largest exporter. Although there\'s a slight discrepancy between these two figures, both are relatively close to the 60% claim made. One source noted an error without providing a specific percentage, which indicates there might be some inconsistency in data or interpretation. However, given that the claim sits between the provided percentages, it is reasonable to conclude that the assertion is close to accurate but slightly overstated. Thus, the claim is rated as \'Mostly True\' since it very closely aligns with the given evidence but is not exactly at the 60% mark."\n}': True, '{\n  "rating": "True",\n  "explanation": "The evidence consistently supports the claim that Texas produces significantly more wind energy than California does. According to the data provided, Texas produced 114,000 megawatt hours of wind energy in 2022, while California produced 14,600 megawatt hours, which means Texas generated nearly eight times more wind energy than California in that year. This is further supported by Texas being ranked 1st in the U.S. for wind energy production, a position it has held for 17 consecutive years, producing more than one-quarter of all U.S. wind-sourced electricity. The reasons for Texas\'s leadership in wind energy production include extremely high wind speeds in certain parts of Texas, an abundance of open land making development cost-effective, strong bipartisan political support, a property tax exemption for wind and solar energy devices, and significant investments in renewable energy infrastructure. The evidence clearly demonstrates that Texas produces a lot more wind energy than California, confirming the claim as true."\n}': True, '{\n  "rating": "Mostly True",\n  "explanation": "The claim that potato chips, KitKat bars, and Viagra are not taxed in Wisconsin because they are considered \'essential\' is mostly true, based on the evidence provided. Potato chips and KitKat bars are not taxed due to their classification under the state\'s tax code. Potato chips are considered food and food ingredients, which are typically exempt from sales tax. KitKat bars are classified as cookies rather than candy because they contain flour, making them exempt from sales tax as well. This classification aligns with the provided evidence that these items are not taxed because they are considered food, which is often exempt under tax codes to ensure that essentials remain affordable. Viagra is tax-exempt because it is a prescription drug, and prescription drugs are commonly exempt from sales tax in many jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, to ensure that essential healthcare products are accessible. However, the term \'essential\' in this context is slightly misleading because the tax-exempt status of these items is more due to their classification under specific tax codes rather than a broad determination of their essentiality. Therefore, the claim is \'Mostly True\' as it accurately reflects the tax-exempt status of these items, though the reasoning is slightly nuanced and based on tax classifications rather than a general essentiality."\n}': True, '{\n  "Rating": "Mostly True",\n  "Explanation": "The evidence indicates that since 1981, a total of five executive appointments by both Democratic and Republican governors were indeed rejected by senators until the tenure of Gov. Tony Evers. During Gov. Tony Evers\' term, Republicans have rejected 15 of his appointees. This information substantially supports the claim that the state Senate has historically rejected five executive appointments since 1981 and illustrates a significant increase during Gov. Evers\' tenure, with the GOP rejecting more than double that historical number. However, the claim is rated as \'Mostly True\' rather than \'True\' because the exact number of executive appointments rejected by the state Senate since 1981 is not directly provided, but the context implies that the numbers mentioned before Gov. Evers\' tenure and during his tenure are exceptional, aligning well with the claim\'s essence. The claim\'s wording may imply a direct comparison without explicitly stating the timeframe for the \'five executive appointments,\' making it slightly ambiguous if those were consecutive or selected instances before Gov. Evers\' term."\n}': True, '{\n  "rating": "True",\n  "explanation": "The evidence provided consistently describes the donation by The LEGO Foundation of 600 LEGO® MRI Scanners to hospitals worldwide. These donations clearly aim to aid children in understanding MRI procedures and alleviating their anxiety about the process. The initiative began as a passion project in 2015, developed by Erik Ullerlund Staehr and Odense University Hospital in Denmark, with the goal of making MRI scans a more positive and less daunting experience for children. The benefits highlighted include making children feel more relaxed, transforming a stressful experience into a positive, playful one, and reducing the need to use anesthesia by preparing children for MRI scans through play. Additionally, the provision of four training videos for medical staff underscores the foundation\'s commitment to facilitating children\'s social and emotional learning through play, further supporting the claim\'s accuracy. Therefore, the claim that \'Lego donates model MRI kits to hospitals to help children understand the procedure and reduce their anxiety\' is rated as \'True\'."\n}': True, '{\n  "rating": "True",\n  "explanation": "The evidence provided consistently shows that it has been U.S. policy to require Americans who intend to be evacuated from overseas due to emergencies such as war, civil unrest, or natural disasters, to sign an Evacuee Manifest and Promissory Note (Form DS-5528). The signing of this note obligates the evacuee to repay the U.S. Government for the cost of the evacuation. This policy is grounded in U.S. law, which permits the State Department to use emergency funds for such evacuations on a reimbursable basis \'to the greatest extent practicable.\' Furthermore, evacuees are billed for the cost of a full-fare economy flight prior to the evacuation events, or for the actual per-person cost of the evacuation, whichever is lower. The requirement for evacuees to sign a promissory note before boarding the evacuation transport, even if the transport is provided by another country at U.S. expense, underscores the seriousness with which this policy is enforced. Given the detail and consistency across the provided sources about the promissory note and its implications for evacuees, it is evident that the practice of requiring a promissory note is ingrained in the U.S. policy regarding the evacuation of its citizens from overseas. However, without specific evidence regarding the exact duration of this policy, such as \'for at least 79 years,\' we cannot directly confirm that particular timeframe. Therefore, the rating is given based on the existence and enforcement of the policy itself, not its duration."\n}': True}
